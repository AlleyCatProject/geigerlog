import getopt                   # parse command line for options and commands

helpOptions = """
Usage:  gconvert.py [Options]
Options:
    -h, --help          Show this help and exit
    -v, --verbose       Be more verbose; print out OLD and NEW records
                        Default is verbose = False
    -f, --from          Name with path of file to read
    -t, --to            Name with path of file to write
    -c, --columns       Column indexes to write in that order; see NOTE

NOTE:
GeigerLog (v0.9.08) needs the data columns as CSV (Comma Separated Values)
strictly(!) in this order:
0      1         2    3    4       5       6       7       8            9         10        11
index, DateTime, CPM, CPS, CPM1st, CPM2nd, CPS1st, CPS2nd, Temperature, Pressure, Humidity, R


whereby:
index       : used for internal purposes (may have any value)
DateTime    : is in a format like: 2018-05-26 13:14:53 (GeigerLog may handle other formats)
CPM:        : the regular CPM readout of the counter
CPS:        : the regular CPS readout of the counter
CPM1st      : CPM data from the first tube
CPM2nd      : CPM data from the second tube
CPS1st      : CPS data from the first tube
CPS2nd      : CPS data from the second tube
T           : Temperature from a RadMon+ with sensor BME280
P           : Pressure    from a RadMon+ with sensor BME280
H           : Humidity    from a RadMon+ with sensor BME280
R           : CPM         from a RadMon+ with Geiger Tube

Any missing column can be created and filled with "missing value" by using 'd'
for dummy column.

Examples:

To convert from a log file created with 'geigerlog_simple_500plus.py' version 0.1,
which has these columns (the index column is missing):
0         1    2    3       4
DateTime, CPS, CPM, CPM1st, CPM2nd
use:  gconvert.py -f <path/to/simplefile> -t <path/to/newfile> -c "d,0,2,1,3,4,d,d,d,d,d,d"


To convert from a log file created with 'geigerlog_simple_500plus.py' version 0.2,
which has these columns (T, P, H, R missing):
0      1         2    3    4       5       6       7
Index, DateTime, CPM, CPS, CPM1st, CPM2nd, CPS1st, CPS2nd
use:  gconvert.py -f <path/to/simplefile> -t <path/to/newfile> -c "0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,d,d,d,d"


To convert from a RadMon+ file, which has these columns:
0      1         2     3        4       5       6
index, DateTime, CPM,  T[Â°C],   H[%],   P[hPa], rssi
use:  gconvert.py -f <path/to/RMfile> -t <path/to/newfile> -c "0,1,d,d,d,d,d,d,3,5,4,2"
